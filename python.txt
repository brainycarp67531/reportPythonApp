Yep 👍 same kind of issue as before.

The module `fitz` comes from the **PyMuPDF** package, but the import name and the pip package name are different.

### ✅ Install PyMuPDF

If you’re using a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash

source venv/bin/activate   # if not already activated
pip install PyMuPDF

```

If you’re not in a venv and want it just for your user:

```bash

pip install --user PyMuPDF

```

---

### ⚡️ Test after install

```bash

python3 -c "import fitz; print(fitz.__doc__[:60])"

```

If no error appears, it’s installed correctly.

👉 Do you want me to walk you through setting up a `requirements.txt` for your `reportPythonApp` so you can install **all needed packages at once** instead of chasing them one by one?
